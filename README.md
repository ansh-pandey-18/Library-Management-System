# üìö Library Management System in C++

This project implements a **Library Management System** using core **C++ data structures** like Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees (BST), Stacks, Queues, and arrays, while incorporating classical algorithms like **Rabin-Karp**, **Naive String Matching**, **LCS**, **Selection Sort**, and **Floyd-Warshall** for extended functionalities.

## üîß Features

- **Add Books** with metadata (ID, title, author, year, copies).
- **Display Books** via:
  - Singly Linked List (Insertion Order)
  - Binary Search Tree (Sorted by Book ID)
- **Issue Books** and maintain:
  - Availability count
  - Book issue history (last 5 via stack)
  - Issued records using maps
  - Waiting list for unavailable books
- **Return Books** with:
  - Waiting list handling
  - Automatic notification
- **Book Search**:
  - Linear Search (case-insensitive)
  - Binary Search (requires sorting)
  - Rabin-Karp Search (for publication year)
- **Sorting**:
  - Selection Sort by title
- **Title Comparison**:
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- **Delivery**:
  - Shortest path calculation via **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
  - Book delivery simulation based on user location

## üß± Data Structures Used

| Data Structure | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `LinkedList`   | Maintains book insertion order |
| `BST`          | Enables sorted book storage by ID |
| `Stack`        | Tracks last 5 book issue/return events |
| `Queue`        | Manages waiting lists per book |
| `Map`          | Tracks issued history and waiting queues |
